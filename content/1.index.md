[Creating Art, Innovation, and Teaching through Code and Design]

Welcome to RobRaves, where creativity walks hand in hand with technology. I'm Robert McCall—a teacher, chef, writer, and artist—exploring the frontiers of AI-driven design.

## Projects

In this section, you'll find the results of my artistic experiments and technological journeys. Each project is a blend of creativity and code, ready to inspire.
